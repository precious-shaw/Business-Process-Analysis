# Business-Process-Analysis
The purpose of the report is twofold: to discover, analyse and comment on the inadequacies of the company(Uber Eats as a case study) business processes; and, in doing so, to justify and evaluate an appropriate selection of Business Analysis techniques and tools. The analysis covered the application and evaluation of techniques and tools which provide for all five activities (strategy analysis, investigate situation, consider perspectives, analyse needs and define requirements) which encompassed these three paradigms: socio-technical, functional and object-oriented.\
<p> The second part of the project  involved analysing provided datasets to explain market basket analysis, association rules, importance of different parameters (e.g., support, confidence, lift etc.), check the outcome of Apriori algorithm with changing the parameters (e.g. support, Confidence, lift etc.) and explain the outcomes (e.g. some suggestions from association rule). <\p>
